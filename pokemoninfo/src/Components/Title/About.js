      <p>This web application allows users to generate a team of Pok√©mon based on their chosen type. It's built using React and the React Router library for navigation.</p>

      <p>An API call to PokeAPI is made using Axios to populate a list of Pokemon types and their associated URLs.  Once a user selects a type, another API call is made to retrieve a list of Pokemon associated with that type.</p>
      <p>The app then randomly selects three Pokemon from that list and displays them on the page with associated information.  A check is made so that each of the three Pokemon displayed have a unique secondary type.</p>
